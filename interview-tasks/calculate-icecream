Question:
You have some amount of money, price for the ice-cream, and some discount stock number. After bying N-ice creams you can use thier barcodes to buy another one.
So you have a function like
calculate_count(money, price, barcode_discount), which should calculate how much ice cream you can buy.
For example:
  If you have: 
calculate_count(10    , 2    , 2)
you can buy: 10 / 2   -> you'll eat 5 ice creams
              for 5 barcode you will eat 2 another icecreams & 1 free barcode
              after eating 2 ice creams you will have 3 barcodes
              after using 3 barcodes you will eat 1 ice cream and 1 unused barcode
              after it you will have 2 barcode and you will eat another 1 ice cream
              in total you will have 9 eaten ice cream and 1 unused barcode

# Answer
def calculate_count(my_money    , price    , ticket_to_icecream):
    if (ticket_to_icecream <=1): raise #если за одну этикетку можно купить мороженно - то их покупать можно бесконечно
    if (price <= 0): raise
    if (my_money <= 0): return 0
    
    bought = tickets =  my_money // price
    print(f"Begin: tickets, bought, {tickets}, {bought}")
    while (tickets >= ticket_to_icecream) :
        new_ice = tickets // ticket_to_icecream
        bought += new_ice
        tickets = (tickets % ticket_to_icecream) + new_ice
        
        print(f"Iteration new-ice, tickets, bought, {new_ice} {tickets}, {bought}")
    return bought
