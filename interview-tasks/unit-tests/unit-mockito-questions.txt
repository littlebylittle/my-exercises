Questions related to mockito framework:
1. How mock works in mockito?  You have a task below, when you are calling an obj with the argument
	'a' - it should return argument 'b' each time?
	example: obj.method('a') -> 'b' every time
	
2.1 Mock like this:
	example: obj.method('a') -> 'b1'
	second call: obj.method('a') -> 'b2'
	third call: obj.method('a') -> 'b3' 
	....etc
	
2.2. Returning multiple values against consecutive method calls:
	like you need to mock only 1st, 2nd, 3rd call with different returning data, how would you do that?
	
3. You have a long chain of call like:
	// new Person().getChildren().getChildren(1).getCustomer().getListOfSubj().connection().name();
	how would you mock this class?
	
4. You have a long chain of objects like:
	Person() *
		-> Children() **
			-> Customer() ***
				-> List<Subj> ****
					-> Connection() -> *****
						Name<String> () ******
	you are callign some logic and want to know what was the intermediate value of the input arugments 
	for the step (****). And what was the result on the step ***. How would you do that?
