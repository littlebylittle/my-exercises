You have a simple text file, for example 10Mb size;
Your task is to revert data inside the file.
You are on linux machine.

##  For example:
> echo -ne 'aaa1bbb2222\ncccc33dddd44\n' > /tmp/simple
> cat /tmp/simple
aaa1bbb2222
cccc33dddd44

> tac /tmp/simple
cccc33dddd44
aaa1bbb2222

#
#So you can you rev/tac commands or write some for cycle or something else;
Don't forget that file could be a large txt file (with logs, or some text-book);
