* Is it possible to join to the thread which was not started? What will happen?
  Examples:
  void method() {
  
          log.info("Startedl application");

        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            log.info("Hello from the thread 1");
        });

//        t1.start();  //usually we expect that this t1 will start and after it we join to this Thread in the main thread; But what if we won't do it?

        t1.join();
        log.info("After join");
//        t1.start(); //what if we will join to thread BEFORE running it? What will happen?
  }
  
  Answer: nothing will happen, the join is possible and happend only to the Thread which was started;
  If thread was not runned - the main thread won't do anything.
  
  Q: Can we join to the thread several times? Is it possible? What will happen?
  A: Yes, possible, nothing will happen, because a thread just become `finished` and that's it;
