So you have a class something like this:
public class Account {
  private int balance; //current amount of money

}


You need to implement a method which takes some amount of money from  account A, subtracts this amount from it and adds this value to the account B (makes a transaction between accounts); 
So you have method something like a `func makeTransaction(Account fromA, Account toB, int amountDelta);`

How would you do it?
What kind of issues would we have?
